    "A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines the properties and behaviors that all objects of that class will have. For example, a class called \"Dog\" might define the properties \"name,\" \"breed,\" and \"age,\" and the behaviors \"bark()\" and \"wagTail().\"\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific entity that has its own unique set of values for the properties of the class.

    "Classes and objects are important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) because they allow programmers to create reusable code. A class can be defined once, and then objects can be created from that class as needed. This makes it easy to create new programs by simply creating new objects from existing classes.\n",

    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an approach to software development that uses objects, or data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions, to design applications and computer programs. The four pillars of OOPs allow developers to better manage software complexity by organizing code into objects and allowing them to interact in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details of an object’s internal structure. By abstracting an object’s data, its structure and behavior can be kept separate and more easily understood.\n",

    "2.Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and related functions into a single unit (object). Encapsulation limits access to object data and methods, preventing their misuse and ensuring their proper functioning.\n",
